# RENTSPOT
An Web App for renting accommodations.

This is a Spring MVC Web App for renting appartments or rooms. 

The main idea is that you can add an offer with infinite number of parameters.

## Technologies stack that was used

- Spring Boot

This app was made in hurry due to the coming deadline. :laughting:

For example the whole @Service layer was ommited in order to make this app works.

I have an intension to rewrite  this app later to Rest + Angular, change concept of curent DB Scheme and to add additional functionality.
